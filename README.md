# Star Wars Holocron Website

Website I built for a friend of mine that runs the [Star Wars Holocron community](https://twitter.com/sw_holocron).
Project was built with the MERN stack (minus Mongo) which is Express, React, and Node. 

## Getting Started
If you would like to run this locally. It is relatively straight forward. Clone locally then

(i)
```
npm install
```

(ii) To run locally: 
```
npm run dev 
```
This will concurrently start the client and server

## Deployment

This website is currently live and in production at [SWHolocron.com](https://swholocron.com). 
It was deployed using Heroku
